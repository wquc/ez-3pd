Quick and easy phase diagrams of 3 components

Evaluate phase diagram of ternary blend numerically[1] as shown in the example below[2]:

Notes:

[1] Since each component is independent with regard to each other, the program is trivially parallelized with OpenMP.

[2] The [python-ternary](https://github.com/marcharper/python-ternary) library is needed to plot the phase diagram. An example can be found in `test/plot-test3d.py`.
