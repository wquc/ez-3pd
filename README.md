Quick and easy phase diagrams of 3 components

Evaluate phase diagram of ternary blend numerically[1] as shown in the example below[2]:

**Notes:**

- Currently only spinodal (unstable) regions are computed and visualized. Diagrams shown in Ref[2] are binodal regions.

- Since each component is independent with regard to each other, the program is trivially parallelized with OpenMP.

- The [python-ternary](https://github.com/marcharper/python-ternary) library is needed to plot the phase diagram. An example can be found in `test/plot-test3d.py`.
